"""
First-time setup for Community-iiSU-PC: bootstraps a self-contained Android SDK and
AVD (sdk_bootstrap.py), patches a copy of iiSU that you supply yourself
(patch_iisu.py) to redirect its ROM launches to a PC-side bridge, installs
it, and points the bridge/ folder at the result.

This never bundles or redistributes iiSU's own APK, you need your own
copy of it, same as you'd need for any other APK-patching tool. Drop it
into input/ before running this (see the printed instructions below if
none is found).
