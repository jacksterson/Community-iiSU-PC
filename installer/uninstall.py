"""
Completely removes everything Setup.bat and day-to-day use create on this
machine, so a fresh Setup.bat run afterward starts truly from scratch,
no reused SDK download, no reused AVD, no leftover config.

Stops the AVD/bridge first (if running) via bridge/stop_iisu_pc.py, then
removes:
  - bridge/'s generated state: the portable SDK+AVD copy, config.json,
    caches, the extracted icon, and the last emulator.log/bridge.log/
    stop.log/launch_history.log
  - installer/'s generated state: its own SDK download, the patch
    keystore, the preserved build-tools copy, working directories
  - the actual AVD(s) under ~/.android/avd/ (and the stray per-AVD log
    directories the emulator leaves alongside it, see NOTE below)
  - the desktop shortcut

Deliberately does NOT touch:
  - installer/input/*.apk, that's your own supplied file, not
    something this project installed
  - installer/tools/apktool.jar, a bundled project asset, not
    generated state
  - %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Android\\Sdk, see the printed note at the end for
    why this is left alone by default

NOTE on ~/.android/avd/medium_phone.avd: sdk_bootstrap.py creates the
AVD under Android's own hardcoded device-profile name first and renames
it afterward (`android emulator create` doesn't support naming it
directly), an interrupted first-time setup can leave that intermediate
name behind before the rename happens, so it's cleaned up defensively
alongside whatever the real configured name is.

Usage:
    python uninstall.py [--yes]
