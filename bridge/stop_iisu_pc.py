"""
Tears down everything start_iisu_pc.py starts (the launch bridge and the
AVD), plus anything else standing in the way of a clean slate. This is
what runs when you click Stop on manager.py's Home page.

Tries a graceful `adb emu kill` first and gives qemu a few seconds to exit
on its own, a clean exit is what lets it release its own lock files
(hardware-qemu.ini.lock, multiinstance.lock) under the portable AVD's own
directory (android-sdk-portable/avd-home/<name>.avd/, see portable_sdk.py).
Skipping straight to a force-kill leaves those locks behind and the *next*
start then fails immediately with "emulator.exe exited early (code 1)", so
force-taskkill is only a fallback for whatever the graceful path doesn't
manage to stop in time, and even then, any leftover lock files are swept
away afterward so the next start isn't blocked by them.

Also stops the adb server (it's a persistent background process that
outlives the AVD it was talking to and never exits on its own).

Deliberately does NOT touch any snapshot state left behind by the
shutdown itself: start_iisu_pc.py's boot-fingerprint check decides on
the *next* start whether that saved snapshot is still trustworthy (a
quick resume) or stale (a fresh cold boot, which naturally overwrites
it on exit). Clearing it here unconditionally would defeat quick resume
before it ever got a chance to be used.
