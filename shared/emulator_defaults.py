"""
Default console -> PC emulator mappings, curated from iiSU's own bundled
emuladores_default.json (its list of consoles and, per console, which
Android packages it recognizes as compatible emulators).

Two shapes, matching bridge/config.json's "emulators" map:

STANDALONE_DEFAULTS: one Android package -> one PC executable. The
Android package chosen is iiSU's own top-priority candidate for that
console (the first "emulators" entry with a "packages" list), it's
stubbed (see installer/stub_apk.py) purely so iiSU's installed-package
check resolves that console to a package our patched LaunchBridge already
recognizes. What that Android package's real app would actually do is
irrelevant: our patch intercepts the launch before Android would ever
start it, and redirects to whatever PC executable is configured here
instead, regardless of whether the two projects are related at all (e.g.
PS2 is stubbed under AetherSX2's package but redirected to PCSX2 on PC,
there's no Android PCSX2 to begin with).

RETROARCH_BY_EXTENSION: a *fallback* for consoles routed through a single
shared com.retroarch stub, used only when iiSU doesn't report which core
it actually launched with (see bridge/launch_bridge.py's
find_emulator_for_package, the LIBRETRO intent extra is trusted first
and unconditionally whenever it's present, since it identifies the
console directly instead of guessing from the ROM's file extension, which
can be ambiguous, .chd is chdman's container for both PS1 and Dreamcast
-- or just plain missing for a console never explicitly added to this
list at all, e.g. an arcade/MAME core resolved from a .zip). Only
extensions that don't collide with another entry in this same map are
included here, for the same reason Saturn and MAME/arcade are left out
entirely: without a reported core to fall back on, their extensions
(.bin/.cue/.iso/.chd/.zip/.7z) overlap too broadly with everything else
on this list to guess correctly from the extension alone.

RetroArch itself is launched as retroarch.exe -L <core> -f <rom>, so
pre_args includes -L and a core path relative to wherever retroarch.exe
is found (standard "cores/xxx_libretro.dll" layout), this assumes the
matching core is already installed there (launch_bridge.py's
ensure_retroarch_core downloads a missing one from the libretro buildbot
automatically), same as RetroArch itself needs to be already installed
for this to do anything.
